# CCSM Coding Class

### Every Friday from 4:00 - 5:30 PM through the Chinese Club of San Marino

## About Us
- ![Sample: Strawberry](/kidcode.jpg)
  - ### Goals
    Coding classes offered by the San Marino Chinese Club will use MITâ€™s Scratch, a graphic-based language that is suitable for younger users. Students will learn how to make clones of popular games like Pong and Agario. These will start simple, but get progressively more complex with each week. Students will have the opportunity to customize these games to their liking and explore the possibilities of coding. Guidance will be provided with a live Zoom lesson on Fridays and self-paced materials that students can access at any time. Teachers will provide technical support for issues like user registration and sharing of projects. We hope that these lessons will be both fun and informative for all involved.
