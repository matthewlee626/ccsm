## Making an Atari Breakout Game in Scratch: Part 2

Two weeks ago, you learned how to make the prototype of the famous Atari Breakout game on Scratch. This week, we'll make this protype a little closer to the real thing.

Try the actual game here: [Atari Breakout](https://elgoog.im/breakout/)

## Code for the Ball:

- ### Bouncing off the Blocks
  - ![A block that bounces the ball off of the blocks](/breakout2/bounceback.png)
    This block simply turns the direction of the ball to the opposite direction (in our case, downwards) and sends it off at a certain angle based on the angle
    in which you hit the block with.

- ### Hiding the Blocks
  - ![A block that hides the blocks upon collision](/breakout2/hideblock.png)
    When the ball hits / touches a block, the block will disappear with the "hide" command! One detail to note is the "wait" block: waiting 0.01 seconds will make sure
    that the ball bounces back before the block disappears or hides.

- ### Score
  - ![A block that increases your score accordingly](/breakout2/bouncebackwithscore.png)
    Whenever your ball hits a block, you score a point! There is no limit to how many points you can score.402px

- ### Game Over
  - ![A block that increases your score accordingly](/breakout2/gameover.png)
  If your ball hits the red line / bottom of the screen, you lose!

## Code for the Paddle:

- ### Moving
  - ![A block that allows the paddle to move](/breakout/moving.png)
    This block tracks you mouse's position, and moves the paddle there. This way, you can control the motion of the paddle by dragging
    your mouse across the game screen. As you can see in the image, the "set x to mouse x block" is repeated forever (until the game finishes, of course),
    so you will be able to constantly move your mouse and the paddle will follow with little to no delay.
